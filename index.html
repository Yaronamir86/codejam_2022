            Every day, we all deal with projects and products of web
            development, often without even thinking that it's not just a
            website but a product of long, diligent teamwork.

            However, my encounter with web design started not long ago. Having
            graduated from college as an electrical engineer, I needed to figure
            out what I want to do next. I am into STEM subjects, and at one
            point I even wanted to go to graduate school, but later abandoned
            the idea. During my college days, I used to go to a lot of meetups,
            and it was at one of these events that I met Elise. d in STEM Well…

            Later on over a cup of coffee, it turned out that Elise is a
            frequent visitor of such events. Moreover, she is an active
            volunteer of GOG (Google Developer's Group), and it was at a GOG's
            event that we met. Elise told me about Practicum, a program that she
            had previously completed herself and then after a while they invited
            her to work with them as a mentor.

            I got so inspired by that program that I couldn't wait to start
            studying and, more importantly, launching projects that I had been
            designing for some time already. That's how, seemingly easily, my
            long road to becoming a web developer began!

            Although in college I was nicknamed a nerd, I am quite an all-round
            and sociable person, and my interests are not limited to
            mathematics. I love reading, mostly science fiction and fantasy, but
            I don't forget about non-fiction either. In college, I got
            interested in computer games. We even created our own clan in World
            of Warcraft and competed with other clans. But my main passion is
            music. I've been playing drums since I was a kid, I graduated from a
            music high school. My best friends are play in a band, and now they
            want to record an album. It was music that inspired me to create my
            projects, some of which were charity projects. With these projects,
            not only was I able to create my portfolio but also launched useful
            websites that are still operating.
